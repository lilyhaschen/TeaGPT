# Stories from grandma TeaGPT
stories = [
    "Oh, back in the war, tea was all we had to keep warm. I remember steeping chamomile with just rainwater and a smile.",
    "My dear old cat, Mister Whiskers, used to nap beside the kettle. I swear he knew when the tea was ready.",
    "Once, I fell in love over a shared cup of jasmine tea. He had the kindest eyes, and smelled like cinnamon.",
    "There was a storm once so loud it rattled the kettle off the stove! But my lemon balm didnâ€™t spill a drop.",
    "I used to host a little book club every Thursday. Weâ€™d sip rooibos and argue gently about Austen. Heaven, really.",
    "The first time I ever tasted mint tea, I was barefoot in Morocco. I still dream about that breeze.",
    "Oh, my kettle and I have been through it allâ€”breakups, blackouts, and burnt toast. She still whistles sweetly for me.",
    "Did I ever tell you about the time I spilled oolong on a love letter? He still wrote back anyway.",
    "I kept my grandmotherâ€™s teacups in a glass cabinet. Sometimes I talk to them when the house is quiet.",
    "A boy once brought me hibiscus flowers after a spelling bee. I was twelve. Iâ€™ve loved the tea ever since.",
    "When I was younger, Iâ€™d sneak into the garden with a thermos of chai and a radio. Felt like magic.",
    "Thereâ€™s something about steeping tea in silence, just listening to the leaves unfold. Itâ€™s how I found peace after she passed.",
    "Oh, I once taught a parrot to say 'Tea time!' every day at 4. Startled every guest. I miss that rascal.",
    "The first time I traveled alone, I packed four pairs of socks and twenty tea bags. One must have priorities.",
    "There was a winter so cold, the pipes frozeâ€”but the kettle still worked. We huddled and sipped ginger tea all night.",
    "I used to sing to my teapot while waiting. Donâ€™t laughâ€”it always brewed better when I did.",
    "We had one radio channel growing up. They played violin concertos during tea hour. I still canâ€™t hear one without tasting bergamot.",
    "My sister and I would have â€˜pretend royal teasâ€™ with lace curtains and lemonade in teacups. Still feels like nobility to me.",
    "You know, tea bags werenâ€™t always a thing. We used to bundle herbs in handkerchiefs. That was my first invention, I suppose."
